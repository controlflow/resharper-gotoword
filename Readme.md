#### Known issues

* By now, ReSharper plugins are not able to register hotkeys after installation (because of VS
integration issues). You can assign keyboard shortcut manually by using VisualStudio's *Options* -
*Environment* - *Keyboard* dialog, just find `ReSharper_GotoWordIndex` action there.

* Users reporting that in some VS versions they are loosing hotkey for plugin every VS restart.
Currently there is no way to workaround this, so you can only use plugin from menu *ReSharper* -
*Navigate* - *Go to Word...* or triple `Ctrl`+`T` hotkey.

* This plugin highly relays on infrastructure changes introduced in ReSharper v8.0 (universal
'word index' cache with language-independent tokenization), so it cannot be easily backported
to 7.x or earlier R# versions.
